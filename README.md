# wordlist-knife: your illiterate friend

Tool for merging, subtracting and generating wordlists.

## Why was it made?

`grep` is fine for many occasions. But I have often found myself
dealing with wordlists and needing to perform some operation on them
that is not always trivial with standard tools, or the ones that are
trivial can get repetitive.

This tool aims to encapsulate simple wordlist related tasks to make
them faster to deal with.
